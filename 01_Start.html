        The Oppenheimer security hearing, conducted by the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1954, explored the
        background, actions and associations of J. Robert Oppenheimer (pictured). He had headed the Los Alamos
        Laboratory during World War II, playing a key part in the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb.
        Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated back to the 1930s, when he was associated with Communist Party USA
        members, including his wife Katherine. He was involved in disputes over the types of nuclear weapons the country
        required, technical disputes over the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb, and personal conflict with AEC
        commissioner Lewis Strauss. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet, but did not recommend that he regain
        his security clearance. This ended his role in government, and he became an academic exile, cut off from his
        former career and the world he had helped to create. The findings were seen as fair by some and as an expression
        of McCarthyism by others. (Full article...)
